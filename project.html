    <h2 style="color:blue;">  About me</h2>
    <p style="color:yellow;">   Hello my name is Kaden I am 13 turning 14 on october 13th. This is my webpage for 8th grade science. I think coding is fun and that its easy. Thats pretty much it if you want an ugly website. But im not here to talk about coding im here to talk about the Periodotic table of elements. Im also suposed to talk a little bit about who I am. I love messing around with electronics, I fixed a Vaccum cleaner that had its motor burnt out. Ive also taken apart my home PC and put it back together many times. I love to play Minecraft,read, and sometimes even draw. Coding is alot easier the most people think it is. Someday I want to work at Microsoft or even maybe even Google to fix and assemble comptures. I like potatoes and watching YouTube(when i can)</p>
